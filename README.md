# ZLIQ

ZLIQ is the intent to create an easy to understand, easy to use web framework. It is based on virtual-dom, redux, reactive-streams.

### Tech

ZLIQ only uses a only view dependencies:
 - [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom)
 - [deep-equal](https://github.com/substack/node-deep-equal) to diff states

ZLIQ implementes itself in a slim way:
 - streams
 - redux
 - virtual-dom rendering for streams
